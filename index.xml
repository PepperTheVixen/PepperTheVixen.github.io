      <description>Have you ever thought about what kind of theme song your character, pet, or fursona might have? Techno, EDM, synthwave, or some rock organ? Maybe you need a retro chiptune for your protogen, or nothing short of a lively tropical jam will do for your parrot. Perhaps there&amp;rsquo;s a suave fox who needs to get down to some heart-pounding EDM or prowl the neon streets of synthwave city. Either way, your character deserves a great tune to go with all of that exquisite artwork you have.</description>
