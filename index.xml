      <description>I recently published my first track, Dwarven Future, and I have an awful lot to say about it.
Getting Into Music This has been a long time coming, and a journey that started almost 2 years ago. I began with a Yamaha Reface CS and later an Arturia Drum Brute Impact. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve slowly built up a collection of equipment to make music entirely on my own.
Doing it Blind This was the single largest barrier to getting into music production.</description>

      <description>Bean Themes Have you ever thought about what kind of theme song your character, pet, or fursona might have? Techno, EDM, synthwave, or some rock organ? Maybe you need a retro chiptune for your protogen, or nothing short of a lively tropical jam will do for your parrot. Perhaps there&amp;rsquo;s a suave fox who needs to get down to some heart-pounding EDM or prowl the neon streets of synthwave city. Either way, your character deserves a great tune to go with all of that exquisite artwork you have.</description>

      <description>Twitch Streams I&amp;rsquo;m on Twitch! Come watch me play games and make music! https://www.twitch.tv/pepperthevixen
What do I stream? I stream games, music, and generally have a good time. I make jokes, say silly stuff, talk to viewers, yell at pixels, and just have fun! Any game I play will be accessible to blind players since I myself am blind! I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about how I play, and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to share info with other blind folk looking to get into (or back into) gaming.</description>
