      <description>You may have noticed a shiny new link on the homepage. Yup, we&amp;rsquo;re on Spotify now. Apple Music and iTunes, too. Amazon music is lagging, but we&amp;rsquo;ll get there. If you&amp;rsquo;d rather buy my stuff outright, I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting on Bandcamp as well!
Follow me on Spotify Folow me on Bandcamp
I&amp;rsquo;m super excited to finally be on the major music stores. It means that I can get my music to more people.</description>

      <description>I recently published my first track, Dwarven Future, and I have an awful lot to say about it.
Getting Into Music This has been a long time coming, and a journey that started almost 2 years ago. I began with a Yamaha Reface CS and later an Arturia Drum Brute Impact. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve slowly built up a collection of equipment to make music entirely on my own.
Doing it Blind This was the single largest barrier to getting into music production.</description>
