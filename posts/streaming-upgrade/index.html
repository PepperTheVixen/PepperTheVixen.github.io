            <p>Video is not my favorite medium. I have always figured I can get by with showing my Logic Pro window on streams. That mostly works, but I&rsquo;ve realized that it&rsquo;s not terribly dynamic. Plus, it leaves a lot to the imagination when it comes to how I do things. If you simply wish to enjoy some music, you can see a demo here. Otherwise, you can read more below.</p>
<p>[poot video here]</p>
<p>After a lot of spitballing and equipment purchases, I now have a decent video setup! No, you won&rsquo;t be seeing my weird human face, however you will be seeing my hands playing music and twisting knobs along with Logic Pro. The setup is simple, but it was surprisingly frustrating to build. The central component of it is the camera. I&rsquo;ve settled on an Anker Powerconf c200 webcam. The reason I selected this camera is because of its resolution and bery wide field of view. These two characteristics mean that I can easily get a clear shot of my keyboard which is very long. I&rsquo;ll go into detail about this in a bit. In order to suspend the camera above the keyboard, I&rsquo;ve used a floor-standing microphone boom arm with a thread adapter. It&rsquo;s working out quite well, however there were some frustrations I had to solve.</p>
<p>First came the task of finding a suitable camera. The go-to for a decade or so now has been the Logitech c920, and more recently the Logitech Brio 4k. I don&rsquo;t like either of these options. After doing a lot more trigonometry than I&rsquo;m comfortable with, I realized that I&rsquo;d need to position the c920 higher than I&rsquo;d want to film the entire keyboard&rsquo;s length. The Brio 4k solves this with a much wider FOV, but it&rsquo;s far too expensive for what I want. I&rsquo;m not producing polished videos. I just want to have stuff people can look at on a livestream. A note on the listed FOV of most webcams: manufactures typically publish the diagonal field of view (DFOV), much in the same way screen sizes are measured diagonally. This is mostly fine until you need the horizontal field of view (HFOV). Uh oh, time to do math and bust out the triangles. I did lots of math to estimate how high I&rsquo;d have to position the c920&hellip; and threw that math right out the window when a friend recommended the Powerconf c200. It&rsquo;s a good webcam, but Anker really need to address the terrible software. Yes, screen-reader accessibility is part of good UX. I&rsquo;ll discuss the software in a moment, as it threw a wrench in my lighting plans.</p>
<p>When first getting everything put together, I realized that audio equipment and video equipment use different threads; microphones use 3/8 and 5/8 inch threading whereas video equipment uses 1/4 inch threading. This was resolved by a small adapter.
Next up was the challenge of lighting. I quickly realized that direct lighting would not work. The Powerconf c200 has a critical problem. It sucks at auto exposure. Now, most people would solve this by modifying exposure settings in the AnkerWork software. Unfortunately this software not only requires a login, it&rsquo;s also completely inaccessible on Mac OS. It features no button labels and many controls can&rsquo;t even be manipulated via Voiceover commands. I&rsquo;m not surprised but I am disappointed.
The result of these problems was a too-bright image that was exacerbated by the hypergloss of the piano keys. I thought I&rsquo;d have to return the thing, but then I had a breakthrough. I&rsquo;m sure other content creators are screaming at me right now. Yes, I used reflected lighting. Between my room&rsquo;s ambient lighting and an LED panel shining light onto the ceiling, I have given the camera sufficient lighting while minimizing glare. Hooray for diffuse reflections!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hardware side done. What about software? I&rsquo;ve stuck with the trusty, albeit not very accessible, OBS to record things. After some fumbling with rotating and fitting the image (and some sighted assistance), I was able to successfully import the footage into Final Cut Pro and used a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_wleVzKojU">very helpful Final Cut Pro guide from SightlessKombat</a> to do some simple editing. The result is the video that you can watch above. For blind viewers, you&rsquo;re not missing much. It&rsquo;s a shot of my hands playing on my MIDI controller along with my logo sprinkled in here and there. Sweet sound. Vibrant video. Heck yes!</p>
